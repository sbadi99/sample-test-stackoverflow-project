 ### Libraries: ###
**Android's Networking Library Volley**. Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. Volley offers the following key benefits:

1) Automatic scheduling of network requests.
2) Multiple concurrent network connections.
3) Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.
    
**Google's GSON parsing library** Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.

**Glide** is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.

**Awesome Splash** Awesome-looking customizable splash screen 

**NOTE:** To access the project, please download the zip file from the repo and and open the project in Android Studio. I have tested on multiple machines, in the rare event there are any build issues please let me know. Also I have tested the app on Android 6.0 and Android 7.0 and some additional emulated devices.

If the team has any questions or need clarifications during the review process, please let me know and I will be happy to address any queries the team may have.
