 ### Libraries: ###
**Android's Networking Library Volley**. Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. Volley offers the following key benefits:

1) Automatic scheduling of network requests.
2) Multiple concurrent network connections.
3) Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.
    
**Google's GSON parsing library** Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.

**Glide** is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.

**Awesome Splash** Awesome-looking customizable splash screen
